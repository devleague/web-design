### What to focus on

The main idea is that we want to focus on good UI/UX and leveraging CSS to accomplish that. Although the default styles will get the job done, we want to use CSS to try make it as easy and visually appealing to the end user as possible.

If users find the design intuitive, easy to use, and nice to look at, conversion rates go up.

Try to think of what all the ways a user can use the application, and also all the ways that the user could stumble when using the application. Think of your mom using your application, and all the questions she would ask.

The main purpose of good design and good UI/UX is to guide the user to the conclusion you want. We use HTML/CSS/JS as tool to ensure that if the user ever goes off the beaten path, we can guide gently back into the right direction.

Good design (and marketing) should help tell a story and engage the user to be a part of that story.
